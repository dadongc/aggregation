# aggregation
a cluster of aggregation algorithm

## KNN
- train set size = 10000
- test set size = 1000
- k = 10
- final accuracy = 0.755
- cost time = 191s

## KMeans
- find k center: 
  - train set size = 10000
  - test set size = 1000
  - k = 10 iter = 30 final accuracy = 0.563 cost time = 82s
  - k = 30 iter = 30 final accuracy = 0.713 cost time = 222s
